** Portfolio Expected Return and Variance
The expected return on a portfolio of assets is the market-weighted average of the expected returns on the individual assets in the portfolio.
The variance of a portfolio's return consists of two components: the weighted average of the variance for individual assets and the weighted covariance between pairs of individual assets.
